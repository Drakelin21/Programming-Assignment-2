Programming 1 Assignment 2 Details:  This program is an upgrade from the previous assignment 1 with an additional method of Graphical format through Kivy.

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It took me around 3 days to full finish it.

2. What are you most satisfied with?
I have been very pleased with the functions I have done within this project. They have all worked all according to their own functions without any further disturbance of multiple triggering actions that were not meant to do at all. The naming of the variable is smoother and much faster to understand and cope with once I got the hang of it.

3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am least satisfied with how you can’t have two books of the same title, both be completed and at least not from within the app itself.

4. What worked well in your development process?
As I get stuck at some codes, I would look back at the practicals that were carried out during the workshops and the lecture slides help a lot whenever I need to know what I am missing out on.

5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
There is always room for improvement and for me, there’d be plenty. Next time, more processing of data and planning before starting with the codes. With better outlay of a project, the main objectives fall right before you.

6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
Python and Kivy websites and the practicals are all the resources that has helped me fulfil my codes to finish up the program.

7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
With little to no knowledge about how to work with the classes and the kivy well yet, a lot of understanding and knowledge is need to be known and I took it to my hands to know what I need to know with the help of some research on the internet which had great tips. With determination and persistence, another year has successfully passed.
